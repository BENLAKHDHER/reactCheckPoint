# React JS Fundamentals

React Checkpoint 01

What You're Aiming For

In this checkpoint, we are going to use what we have learned so far to play around with some React components and JSX.


Instructions


 ·        Create a project using create-react-app

·        Create App.js in the src folder and use it as a root component for your React app.

·        Create a file called product.js with a json object of a product’s name, price, description, and a path or URL to an image. (Don’t forget to export the json object)

·        Create four components that return the product’s name, price, description, and image. (Name.js, Price.js, Description.js, and Image.js)

·        Export all your components so that they can be used in the root component (in App.js)

·        Import the json object created previously into all newly created components.

·        Create a card that contains all components created using react-bootstrap in your App.js.


·        Display an image if the first name is provided.

·        Be creative as much as possible with your styling!

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript and enable type-aware lint rules. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
